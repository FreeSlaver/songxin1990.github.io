目的是什么？？赚更高工资？那你应该面向PPT，面向工资编程，并不需要成为一个编程高手。  


Jobh Carmack:
Write losts of code.Clone existing things as exercises.Learn deeply.
Alternate trying yourself and reading literature.Be obsessive.

Edward Kmett:
Most of my programming career has involved finding something neat,
writing my own version to understand it & ofen throwing it away.

I program those "clones" like I read papers:chage a core part;readesign  it.
Gain progress or understanding why it is what it is.
